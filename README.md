# SelfMaxx - Scheduling Automation App

#**What Does It Do?**
SelfMaxx contains a chatbot that will create entire schedules for the user based on their natural language input, and these schedules integrate with Google Calendar in a single click. 

For example, the user tells the chatbot they must walk their dog for 30 minutes in the evening and they have a birthday dinner at 9 PM. The chatbot will create a schedule based off the user's criteria and times, and the user will be able to add every event to their Google Calendar in one click.

**Achieves up to 50% faster time completion for scheduling daily tasks compared to manual scheduling methods.**
